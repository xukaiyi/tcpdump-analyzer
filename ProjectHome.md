The project was written in a few hours for my university task... the main reason I'm publishing it here is because I need to get familiar with Google Code hosting :)

You might find this code usable for educational purposes, I hope.

Written in C++, makefile for Linux systems included. Compiled & tested on Ubuntu.

I haven't tried compiling it on Windows, but it should be possible. Please however have a look at output coloring definition in main.h
